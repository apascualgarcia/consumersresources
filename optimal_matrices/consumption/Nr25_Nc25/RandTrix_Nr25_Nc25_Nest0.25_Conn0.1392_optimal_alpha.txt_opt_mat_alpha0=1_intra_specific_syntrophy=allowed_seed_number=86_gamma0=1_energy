# The following metaparameters were used for this matrix optimization : gamma0 = 1; alpha0 = 1; sigma0 = 0.25; l0 = 1;p = 1; R0 = 1; S0 = 0.05; NR = 25; NS = 25; matrix path = optimal_matrices/consumption/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.1392.txt; convergence threshold = 1e-08
# Energy optimization to find the best syntrophy matrix for a given consumption matrix 
# Are given, in that order: energy, A-nestedness, A-connectance, G-nestedness, G-connectance and temperature of the syntrophy matrix
# This line is the converged value at the end of the MCS optimization algorithm
