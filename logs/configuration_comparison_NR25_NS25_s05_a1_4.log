[2019-12-02 01:47:39] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-02 01:47:39] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -821.045 81600.1 -2.7045e+06 2.98893e+07)
[2019-12-02 01:47:39] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
