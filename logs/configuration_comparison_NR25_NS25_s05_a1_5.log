[2019-12-02 18:20:17] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-02 18:20:17] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -7263.1 1.21045e+06 -6.72407e+07 1.24503e+09)
[2019-12-02 18:20:17] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
