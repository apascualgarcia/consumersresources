[2019-12-02 03:15:30] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-02 03:15:30] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 0.727109 -31.4849 -3865.85 -457830)
[2019-12-02 03:15:30] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
