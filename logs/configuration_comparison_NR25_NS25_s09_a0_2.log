[2019-11-29 07:21:28] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 07:21:28] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 1936.81 -505039 4.38904e+07 -1.27122e+09)
[2019-11-29 07:21:28] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
