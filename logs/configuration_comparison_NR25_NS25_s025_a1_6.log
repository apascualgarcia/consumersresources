[2019-12-02 16:50:32] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-02 16:50:32] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -1731.97 1.071e+06 -2.20748e+08 1.51651e+10)
[2019-12-02 16:50:32] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
