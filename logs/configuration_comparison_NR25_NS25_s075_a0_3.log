[2019-11-30 00:10:41] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-30 00:10:41] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -759.524 257198 -2.9029e+07 1.09205e+09)
[2019-11-30 00:10:41] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
