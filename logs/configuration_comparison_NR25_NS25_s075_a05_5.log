[2019-11-29 12:19:32] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 12:19:32] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 23.2545 -4467.78 279047 -5.6988e+06)
[2019-11-29 12:19:32] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
