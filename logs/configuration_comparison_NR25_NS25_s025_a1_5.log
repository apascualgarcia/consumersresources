[2019-12-03 10:05:23] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-03 10:05:23] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 609.209 -93036.6 4.7341e+06 -8.02579e+07)
[2019-12-03 10:05:23] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
