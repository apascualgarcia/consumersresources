[2019-11-29 06:33:14] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 06:33:14] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -276.058 157537 -2.99704e+07 1.90084e+09)
[2019-11-29 06:33:14] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
