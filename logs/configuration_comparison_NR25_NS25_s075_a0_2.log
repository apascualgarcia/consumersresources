[2019-11-29 20:42:06] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 20:42:06] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -4402.42 1.15205e+06 -1.00487e+08 2.92152e+09)
[2019-11-29 20:42:06] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
