[2019-12-02 17:03:03] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-02 17:03:03] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -102.46 24386.8 -1.93783e+06 5.14243e+07)
[2019-12-02 17:03:03] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
