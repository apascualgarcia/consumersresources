[2019-11-29 17:51:19] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 17:51:19] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 0.725867 -11.2232 -544.025 -24301.2)
[2019-11-29 17:51:19] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
