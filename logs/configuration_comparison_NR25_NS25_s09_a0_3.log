[2019-11-29 08:59:40] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 08:59:40] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -8032.22 2.74366e+06 -3.1239e+08 1.1856e+10)
[2019-11-29 08:59:40] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
