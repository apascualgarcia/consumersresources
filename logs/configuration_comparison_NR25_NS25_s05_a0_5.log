[2019-12-01 09:21:16] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-01 09:21:16] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -1889.74 307108 -1.66354e+07 3.00352e+08)
[2019-12-01 09:21:16] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
