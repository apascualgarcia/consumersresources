[2019-12-01 12:48:14] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-01 12:48:14] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 261.495 -15510.3 -43043.8 9.81647e+06)
[2019-12-01 12:48:14] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
