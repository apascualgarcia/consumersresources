[2019-12-02 17:02:51] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-02 17:02:51] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -6.81481 596.047 59258 -5.16436e+06)
[2019-12-02 17:02:51] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
