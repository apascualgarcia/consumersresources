[2019-12-02 21:14:13] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-02 21:14:13] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 194.117 -117177 2.35663e+07 -1.57852e+09)
[2019-12-02 21:14:13] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
