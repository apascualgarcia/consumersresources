[2019-12-03 09:17:15] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-03 09:17:15] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 137.037 -32572 2.57583e+06 -6.77621e+07)
[2019-12-03 09:17:15] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
