[2019-12-01 11:08:12] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-01 11:08:12] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -29.9182 5863.17 -383723 8.4031e+06)
[2019-12-01 11:08:12] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
