[2019-12-03 08:49:43] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-03 08:49:43] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -137.764 16513.1 -661259 8.8498e+06)
[2019-12-03 08:49:43] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
