[2019-11-28 23:20:38] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-28 23:20:38] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -350.604 96866.8 -8.92275e+06 2.74047e+08)
[2019-11-28 23:20:38] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
