[2019-11-29 06:36:14] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 06:36:14] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 37002.8 -6.40316e+06 3.69332e+08 -7.10072e+09)
[2019-11-29 06:36:14] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
