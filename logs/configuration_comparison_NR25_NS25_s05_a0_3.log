[2019-12-01 09:30:09] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-12-01 09:30:09] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 1836.91 -570180 5.89868e+07 -2.03378e+09)
[2019-12-01 09:30:09] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
