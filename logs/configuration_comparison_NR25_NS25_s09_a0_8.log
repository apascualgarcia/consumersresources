[2019-11-29 17:44:54] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 17:44:54] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = -92387.6 2.07725e+07 -1.55682e+09 3.88926e+10)
[2019-11-29 17:44:54] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
