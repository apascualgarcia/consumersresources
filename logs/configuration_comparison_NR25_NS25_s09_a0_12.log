[2019-11-29 20:00:18] Now fitting the 10 chosen into the specific function
[2019-11-29 20:00:18] Now we find the zero of the fit to determine delta critical (parameters = 0.743343 -27.0487 -3064.31 -337729)
[2019-11-29 20:00:18] We interpret the fitting parameters as coefficients of a degree 3 polynomial (which should be true, please check that)
