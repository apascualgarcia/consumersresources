We discovered in the previous section that we expect microbial communities where a large syntrophic interaction is observed to have a large consumption rate $\gamma_0$ and a small abundance of consumers at equilibrium $S_0$. It is time to work with feasible systems and investigate their dynamics. We now spend our energy on studying the local dynamical stability of feasible microbial communities. In short, we want to know what happens to them when their populations (of both resources and microbes) at equilibrium are perturbed. The question of the stability of ecosystems has always been and still remains of prime importance for ecologists and constitutes a whole scientific field. Many results have been derived, for linear systems \cite{may_will_1972}, Lotka-Volterra systems \cite{bunin_ecological_2017, takeuchi_global_1996}, mutualistic systems \cite{pascual-garcia_mutualism_2017} or MacArthur's consumer-resource model \cite{chesson_macarthurs_1990}. An important trend, which we will check with our results, is that highly connected ecological networks\footnote{This was demonstrated explicitly for mutualistic systems by \citeauthor{pascual-garcia_mutualism_2017} in \cite{pascual-garcia_mutualism_2017}.} seem to be more robust to perturbations\textbf{This was proven for structural stability, is it also true for dynamical stability?}.

In the next section we first discuss about the MCMC algorithm (Methods \ref{section: methods LRI MC solver}) designed to shape more dynamically stable systems. We then move on to study the dynamical stability of microbial communities by examining the shape of their fully dynamically stable regions, looking in what case feasibility implies dynamical stability and checking how the largest eigenvalue changes with the shape of the consumption-syntrophy network. Finally we will investigate what happens when the number of resources in the community is changed.

\subsection{LRI regime -- Outcome of the MCMC algorithm}
Methods \ref{section: methods LRI MC solver} explains how we designed an algorithm whose goal is to find, for a given consumption matrix $G$, the syntrophy matrix $A$ that should bring us closer to the satisfaction of Eq.\eqref{eq: strong LRI regime}, which we know is a dynamically stable regime. The shape of the $A$-matrix that is the outcome of the algorithm minimizes the energy $E(G,A)$ (Eq.\ref{eq: dynamical stability methods LRI MC solver energy definition}). Namely, $A$ should have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item The sum of the diagonal elements of $AG$ is minimized. Because $(AG)_{\mu\mu}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_S} A_{\mu i} G_{i\mu}$ corresponds to the number of species that both consume and release resource $\mu$, we expect the algorithm to yield $A$-matrices that minimize intraspecific syntrophy.
\item The sum of the off-diagonal elements of $\abs{\alpha_0 AG-\gamma_0 R_0 G^T G}$ is minimized. This means that outside the diagonal, we should have $\frac{\alpha_0}{\gamma_0 R_0} AG \approx  G^T G$. A direct ecological interpretation is harder to draw. For a couple of different resources $(\mu,\nu)$,  $(AG)_{\mu\nu}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_S} A_{\mu i} G_{i\nu}$ is the number of species that at the same time consume resource $\nu$ and release resource $\mu$ and $(G^TG)_{\mu\nu}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_S} G_{i\mu}G_{i\nu}$ is the number of consumers that eat both $\nu$ and $\mu$. \textbf{TO DO: add something here, transition is a bit rough}
\end{itemize}
So intuitively the LRI MCMC algorithm should give us a syntrophy matrix that both limits intraspecific syntrophy and such that for every couple of different resources $(\mu, \nu)$, the number of consumers that eat both $\mu$ and $\nu$ is proportional to the number of consumers that eat $\mu$ and release $\nu$. The proportionality constant, which is the same for all $(\mu, \nu)$ is equal to the ratio of the syntrophy and consumption interactions.
 Since the connectance and the dimensions of $A$ are fixed, the number of links of $A$ is already decided and the algorithm simply determines how to optimally distribute them. Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical shape of consumption syntrophy LRI algorithm} shows that typically the algorithm will put links in a cell $(\mu,i)$ if $(i, \mu)$ is zero, meaning that not only intraspecific syntrophy tries to be avoided but also species that consume a lot of resources will tend to release few of them and vice-versa.

Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability optimal LRI requirements met} shows that indeed we obtain for a given $G$ matrix a syntrophy matrix $A$ such that the two requirements above are best satisfied. Note that the algorithm works better for matrices with a low connectance. \textbf{TO DO: explain why}
It is worth noticing that this procedure produces highly nested syntrophy matrices (Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results nestedness LRI outcome}) where only a few species produce most of the syntrophic flow. The obtained matrices have an even larger nestedness if we increase the number of resources. \textbf{TO DO : check if can speak of syntrophic overlap for nestedness of syntrophy matrix}

\subsection{Typical dynamical stability}
We observed in Results \ref{sec : feasibility without syntrophy} that, for all $(G,A) \in S_{25}$, at fixed $\alpha_0$ the metaparameters feasibility function $\mathcal{F}\left(m, G, A\right)$ has a typically sharp transition from fully feasible $(\mathcal{F}=1)$ to fully unfeasible ($\mathcal{F}=0$) regimes in the $(\gamma_0, S_0)$ plane. Figure \ref{fig : dynamical stability results typical dynamical stability function} shows that a similar although more complicated behaviour is observed in the case of the dynamical stability function $\mathcal{D}_L\left((\gamma_0, S_0, \alpha_0), G, A\right)$. On one hand, the $(\gamma_0, S_0)$ plane is split in two distinct zones, which are also separated by a very narrow boundary. The first zone is characterised by complete dynamical instability, \ie $\mathcal{D}_L =0$. On the other hand, the second zone is not described by full dynamical stability, but rather \important{almost} full dynamical stability: $\mathcal{D}_L$ is very close to but not always exactly equal to 1. The consequence is that the fully dynamically stable region $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}$ will be very patchy (see below for a longer discussion on this).

That patchiness could come from purely numerical effects: $\mathcal{D}_L$ is estimated by generating $N_\text{sys}$ parameters sets and counting the proportion that is dynamically stable, which inevitably leads to an uncertainty on $\mathcal{D}_L$ that could explain the patchiness. Or it could come from a genuine complicated topology of $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}$. In a future project, increasing $N_\text{sys}$ would allow to reduce the relative uncertainty on $\mathcal{D}_L$ and truly discover the origin of this interesting phenomenon.


\subsection{Fully dynamically stable region}
The same way we studied the fully feasible volume $\mathcal{F}_{1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)$, we investigate now the behaviour of its special subset, the locally fully dynamically stable region $\mathcal{D}^{G,A}_{L,1}\left(\alpha_0\right)$, which is defined\footnote{A formal definition of the fully dynamically stable region $\mathcal{D}^{G,A}_{L,1}$ is provided in Methods \ref{sec: dynamical stability methods locally dynamically stable region}.} as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}\left(\alpha_0\right) \defined \left\{ (\gamma_0, S_0) : (\gamma_0, S_0, \alpha_0) \in \mathcal{D}^{G,A}_{L,1} \right\}.
\end{equation}
 Intuitively, $\mathcal{D}^{G,A}_{L,1}\left(\alpha_0\right)$ corresponds to the set of all $(\gamma_0, S_0)$ such that $\mathcal{A}\left((\gamma_0, S_0, \alpha_0), G, A\right)$ is a feasible, locally dynamically stable parameters set with probability 1. Since we require $\mathcal{A}\left((\gamma_0, S_0, \alpha_0), G, A\right)$ to be feasible, it is clear that $\mathcal{D}^{G,A}_{L,1}\left(\alpha_0\right)$ is indeed a subset of $\mathcal{F}^{G,A}_1\left(\alpha_0\right)$.

 As a naive approach, one could take a look at the \important{common fully locally dynamically stable region}, which is the intersection of the $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0) \forall (G,A) \in S_M$ (Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results common fully dynamically stable volume}). However, as said before, because of the patchy and heterogenous nature of each $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)$, we observe a very fractured and small common fully locally dynamically stable region, which is the same for all structures of $A$ considered. It has a non-zero volume for $\alpha_0=0$, but for the next point investigated $\alpha_0=\num{1.3e-3}$, no point is fully locally dynamically stable for every matrix considered, which means that the critical common syntrophy is smaller than this. This means that contrarily to the case of feasibility, we must find another, more subtle, approach to study dynamical stability. We have to consider each consumption-network individually.

As we saw, $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}\left(\alpha_0\right)$ is geometrically more complex than $\mathcal{F}_{1}^{G,A}\left(\alpha_0\right)$ (Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results local dynamical stability region for different matrices}) because of the \important{almost} fully dynamically stable points\footnote{One may argue then that we should also consider the {almost} fully dynamically stable points in the analysis. That position is intellectually appealing but would require to either work in a completely different framework or choose a ``stability threshold'' which separates almost fully feasible points from the others. The arbitrariness of said threshold (should we take into account points above $\mathcal{D}_L=0.99$? Or above $\mathcal{D}_L=0.98$? What about $0.995$?) would make such a point of view hard to hold.}.
%(which is after all not suprising, the question of dynamical feasibility is harder than the one of feasibility!)
 It may sometimes have holes, even without syntrophy, and sometimes not, even for matrices that are topologically very close. Compare for instance Fig.\ref{fig: lds region results Nest 0.35 Conn 0.2208} with Fig.\ref{fig: lds region results Nest 0.35 Conn 0.272}, these two networks have the same ecological overlap, but even though their connectance is very similar, their fully locally dynamically stable regions have a very different shape: one of them can sustain only a tiny bit of syntrophy before becoming dynamically unstable (Fig.\ref{fig: lds region results Nest 0.35 Conn 0.2208}) while the second can endure basically any feasible syntrophic interaction (Fig.\ref{fig: lds region results Nest 0.35 Conn 0.272}). As a general trend, points with a larger $\gamma_0$ and a smaller $S_0$ remain dynamically stable (Fig.\ref{fig : dynamical stability results center of stability}). The question is then: why do other points lose their dynamical stability? Is it because they become unfeasible, or do they remain feasible but become dynamically unstable?
%We required that a system had to be feasible in order to be dynamically stable, which is the mathematical equivalent of $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0) \subset \mathcal{F}_1^{G,A}\left(\alpha_0\right)$, \ie local dynamical stability implies feasibility. We may also ask the reverse question, does feasibility imply local dynamical stability?

To answer that question, we quantify for each network $(G,A) \in S_{25}$ the \define{probability of being dynamically stable when feasible}, denoted $\text{Prob}\left(\mathcal{D}_L | \mathcal{F}\right)(G,A, \alpha_0)$. That quantity, formally defined in Appendix \ref{app : probability of being dynamically stable when feasible}, has a straight forward interpretation:
%it computes the average probability over the $(\gamma_0, S_0)$ plane that a $(\gamma_0, S_0, \alpha_0)$ point is dynamically stable if we know it is feasible. In short,
if for a certain $(G,A)$, $\text{Prob}\left(\mathcal{D}_L | \mathcal{F}\right)(G,A, \alpha_0)=x$, then a feasible $(\gamma_0, S_0, \alpha_0)$ has on average a chance $x$ to be dynamically stable\footnote{More precisely, there is a chance $x$ that a parameters set $\mathcal{A}\left((\gamma_0, S_0, \alpha_0), G, A\right)$, which we know is feasible, is also dynamically stable.}. Figure \ref{fig : dynamical stability results proba feas -> dyn sta} shows that $\text{Prob}\left(\mathcal{D}_L | \mathcal{F}\right)(G,A, \alpha_0)< 1$ $\forall (G, A) \in S_{25}$ and $\forall \alpha_0 \geq 0$. That result has a very important biological consequence : for no consumption-syntrophy network and at no syntrophy are all feasible systems dynamically stable, \ie there can always exist feasible but dynamically unstable microbial communities\footnote{This does not mean they will survive, of course, since they can vanish at any small perturbation. However it means that there is no physical law that hinders their existence: they can exist, and could appear \eg through mutation processes.}. \textbf{TO DO : if time left, do a fit of the slope but not sure if that is very relevant or what it can tell (rate at which you lose dynamical stability?)-> would show that LRI improves stuff at low connectance.}

%The answer to this is, again, unsurpisingly, ``it depends on the matrix'', as shows Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results local dynamical stability region for different matrices}. For instance, for $G$ with $\kappa_G=0.13$ and $\eta_G=0.1$, we have $\text{Vol}\left(\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)\right) < \text{Vol}\left(\mathcal{F}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)\right) \forall \alpha_0$, which means that for this consumption matrix feasibility does not imply stability. The fully connected case gives a larger dynamically stable volume than the regime without intraspecific syntrophy which is itself better than the LRI regime. This hints that the LRI regime, despite what it was designed for, apparently does not give better results than other structures of $A$.
%On the contrary, for $G$ with $\kappa_G=0.32$ and $\eta_G=0.6$, both volumes are equal at every syntrophy that is feasible, for the three structures of $A$ considered, which shows that for this specific matrix, feasibility implies local dynamical stability.

\textbf{TO DO : talk about the fact that LRI does not improve anything}

% A good way to measure how systems react to syntrophy is to compute the \important{critical locally dynamically stable syntrophy} $\alpha_0^D(G,A)$ (see Methods \ref{sec: methods dynamical stability}). An easy way this can be done is by getting some points of the volume of $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}\left(\alpha_0\right)$ curve and finding its intercept to zero. Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical shrinkage of dynamical volume} shows the typical shrinkage of the fully locally dynamically stable volume.
% To find $\alpha_0^D(G,A)$ for each $G$, we fit with a linear function the last four points of the curve corresponding to Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical shrinkage of dynamical volume} and find its intercept to zero $\alpha_0^D(G,A)$. Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results critical dynamical syntrophy} shows a very interesting and clear behaviour\footnote{Those results have to be taken with a grain of salt because we did not check whether $\alpha_0^D(G,A)$ was feasible, \ie the actual critical locally dynamically stable syntrophy is the minimum between the value measured in Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results critical dynamical syntrophy} and the largest feasible $\alpha_0$ for that couple $(G,A)$.}: for a given connectance of the consumption matrix, systems that can sustain the largest syntrophy have a small ecological overlap. And for a given ecological overlap, systems with a larger connectance will stay stable longer under the action of syntrophy. In the end, optimal systems have a small ecological overlap and a large connectance: many resources are eaten by the consumers, but they do not share them.

Similarly to what was done for feasibility in Results \ref{sec : feasibility results influence of matrix topology}, we can measure the volume of dynamical stability \textbf{TO DO: check this is the right name} (see Appendix \ref{app: how to measure volume}) $\text{Vol}\left(\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)\right)$ of each consumption-syntrophy network $(G,A)$. $\text{Vol}\left(\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)\right)$ tells us what proportion of the unit square is occupied by dynamically stable $(\gamma_0, S_0)$ points and is therefore an indicator of how well communities can sustain an increase of average syntrophic strength $\alpha_0$.
Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical shrinkage of dynamical volume} shows that the dynamically stable volume typically decays in an exponential-like fashion. We inspire ourselves from the work of Results \ref{sec : feasibility results influence of matrix topology} to quantify that decay, and define the \define{dynamical stability decay rate} $d_D(G,A)$ of a consumption-syntrophy network $(G,A)$. It is obtained numerically by finding through a non-linear regression the coefficients $c_1, c_2, d_D \in \mathbb{R}^+$ that satisfy best the relation:
\begin{equation}
\text{Vol}\left(\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)\right) \approx c_1 \exp\left(-d_D \alpha_0\right)-c_2.
\end{equation}
Much like for the corresponding discussion in the case of feasibility, $d_D(G,A)$ is an indicator of how well a consumption-syntrophy network $(G,A)$ can sustain syntrophy while remaining dynamically stable: a smaller $d_D(G,A)$ indicates a more robust network (it will take a larger syntrophy to find unstable points), a larger $d_D(G,A)$ shows the network is weak against an increase in syntrophic interaction. Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results dynamical decay rate FC} shows how $d_D(G,A)$ changes as a function of the characteristics of the consumption matrix $G$, $\forall G \in G_{25}$. A clear trend may be seen: in order to avoid losing dynamical stability when syntrophy is increased, a microbial community should either increase the number of average resources eaten by each consumer (\ie increase the connectance of the consumption matrix) or decrease its ecological overlap, which means that consumers should stop eating from the same resources (an intuition on why this makes sense biologically is provided in the next section \textbf{TO DO: rewrite something here better}). Figure \ref{fig : dynamical stability results decay rate away from FC case} shows how $d_D(G,A)$ changes for each matrix as different syntrophy regimes are considered. The following comments can be made\footnote{In the following, we use terms like ``is better'', ``outperforms'' or ``improves the dynamical stability'' as a way of saying ``lowers the dynamical stability decay rate compared to the FC case''.}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The NIS scenario does not significantly decrease the dynamical stability decay rate. It consistantly decreases it by $\sim 5-15\%$ \textbf{TO DO: check errors}, except in the case $\kappa_G = 0.18, \eta_G=0.15$, where $d_D(G,A)$ is decreased by $\sim 30\%$.
\item The LRI scenario greatly improves ($> \sim 50\%$) the dynamical stability for consumption matrices with a very low connectance. On average, the lower the connectance, the greater the improvement. However, for larger connectances, it does not change $d_D(G,A)$ in any way.
\item The RS scenario offers the best improvement: any consumption matrix we considered got a considerably better result (at least $>\sim 20 \%$ ). At fixed connectance, the improvement is the same for every ecological overlap considered and the lower the connectance the better the improvement.
\end{itemize}
Overall, the LRI and RS scenarios offer a more significant improvement the lower the connectance of the consumption matrix. Because both have a syntrophy matrix whose connectance is equal to the one of the consumption matrix, this suggests that microbial communities which have very few syntrophic interactions (\ie $A$ has a low connectance) can remain dynamically stable with a larger average syntrophic interaction than others. Because the random structure (RS) scenario is, for a given matrix, a better improvement than LRI, we think that the syntrophy matrix should also have a lower syntrophic overlap, \ie a low nestedness\footnote{Indeed, the LRI regime has a significantly more nested syntrophy matrix compared to RS (Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results nestedness LRI outcome}). At equal connectance, $A$ with the lower nestedness provides a better improvement.}.\textbf{TO DO: write why that makes sense, you depend less on the others who are changed with the perturbation}





\subsection{Largest eigenvalue of the jacobian} \label{sec: largest eigenvalue of the jacobian}
Equation \eqref{eq : dynamical stability methods fully connected metaparameters} from Methods \ref{sec : methods dynamical stability fully connected zero variance} gives a relationship that the metaparameters should approximately follow in order to give rise to locally dynamically stable systems. Although strictly speaking it is only valid for the case where both $G$ and $A$ are fully connected, we expect it to work as well when $G$ and $A$ are \important{not too far away} from the fully connected case. It tells us that in order to get more local dynamically stable systems we should\footnote{We do not focus on how $R_0$ and $l_0$ should be changed because they are always equal to $1$ for our study of feasibility and local dynamical stability. }:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decrease $N_S$ %, $l_0$ \textbf{WEIRD RESULT: would expect that increasing l0 would make systems more dynamically stable (observed in simulations I think)}
or $\alpha_0$.
  \item If $\alpha_0 - \gamma_0 R_0 < 0$, increase $N _R$, $\sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$.
  \item Be careful in how you handle $S_0$: %increasing $S_0$ reduces the $l_0^2/S_0$ term but increases the $N_S^2 \alpha_0^2 S_0$ term. It is very easy to show (Appendix \ref{sec: appendix how to handle S0}) that if $S_0 > l_0/(N_S \alpha_0)$ it should be decreased, and otherwise it should be increased until it reaches $l_0/(N_S \alpha_0)$.
  Appendix \ref{sec: appendix how to handle S0} shows that at very low syntrophy, we should increase $S_0$ but decrease it when $\alpha_0$ becomes very significant. Since in practice the observed feasible $\alpha_0$ are fairly low, we  should increase $S_0$ as much as possible.
\end{itemize}
Combining these considerations with the feasibility conditions Eq.\eqref{eq : fully feasible volume} we expect that -- for all other metaparameters fixed -- systems get more and more locally dynamically stable as $\gamma_0$ is increased and $S_0$ has its largest feasible value. In short, points at the upper border of $\mathcal{D}^{G,A}_{L,1}(\alpha_0)$ should have a lower and lower $\real{\lambda_1}$ as $\gamma_0$ increases. Figure \ref{fig: local dynamical stability results largest eigenvalue} shows that indeed that trend is indeed observed.
This tells us that if we keep the consumption flux $N_S \gamma_0 S_0$ constant, increasing $\gamma_0$ (and hence decreasing $S_0$) will give rise to more stable systems. Notice that contrarily to the prediction made above, increasing $\alpha_0$ does not decrease stability but increases the maximal $\abs{\real{\lambda_1}}$ observed as shows Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical maximal eigenvalue observed varying syntrophy}. That is coupled with the already discussed shrinkage of the fully locally dynamically stable volume seen on Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results shrinkage of DL1G varying syntrophy}. This means that overall increasing syntrophy makes the system \important{more stable} but at \important{fewer points}. This hints that systems in a high syntrophic regime, where consumers produce a lot of resources, should be very fine-tuned and occur for very specific consumption strength and average abundance of consumers.\textbf{TO DO : need to elaborate more?}


\subsection{The influence of the matrix dimension}
As said above, because of Eq.\eqref{eq : dynamical stability methods fully connected metaparameters}, we expect dynamical stability to improve when the number of resources is increased and the number of consumers is kept fixed. It is therefore worth briefly studying what happens when the number of resources is doubled $N_R=25 \rightarrow N_R=50$ and every other metaparameter, as well as the number of consumers, keeps the same value as before.
Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical lds region NR=50 NS=25} shows that the effect of adding resources can be quite dramatic on the stability of the system. For that specific matrix for instance, adding resources allowed for a way larger $\mathcal{D}^{G,A}_{L,1}\left(\alpha_0\right)$ at each $\alpha_0$. It even allows full dynamical stability in the feasibility region for larger syntrophic interactions than before.
Even though more syntrophy can be sustained, it seems that the volume of $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{G,A}(\alpha_0)$ is smaller at $N_R=50$ than at $N_R=25$ (compare for  instance Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results shrinkage of DL1G varying syntrophy NR=50} with Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results shrinkage of DL1G varying syntrophy}). This is compensated by the fact that way larger eigenvalues are observed at $N_R=50$: although there are (a bit) fewer equilibrium points, these are more stable (compare Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical maximal eigenvalue observed varying syntrophy NR=50} and Fig.\ref{fig: dynamical stability results typical maximal eigenvalue observed varying syntrophy}). This is a trend that we believe holds for all the matrices considered but a more thorough investigation should be conducted before claiming those results to be absolutely true. Since matrices are individually more locally dynamically stable, the \important{common locally dynamically stable} region is larger with $N_R=50$ resources than with $N_R=25$. The difference between Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results common fully dynamically stable volume} and Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results common lds volume NR=50 NS=25} is very striking: when the number of resources is increased not only is $\mathcal{D}_{L,1}^{S_M}\left(\alpha_0\right)$ larger, it also can overall bear a larger syntrophy. Remember that for $N_R=25$, the critical common syntrophy was between $0$ and $\num{1.3e-3}$, and for $N_R=50$, it is way larger, between $\num{3.9e-3}$ and $\num{5.2e-3}$. \textbf{Is there anything more to add? I have some plots but I am not sure if they are the most relevant}
