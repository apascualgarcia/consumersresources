\caption{Critical structural perturbation $\Delta_S^*(m,G,A)$ (a) as a function of ecological overlap with fixed connectance and (b) as a function of connectance for a fixed ecological overlap. The critical perturbations are not very high, of the order of one percent. A clear trend may be observed, which is coherent with what was seen in Figure \ref{fig: dynamical stability results critical dynamical syntrophy}: for a given connectance, communities with a large ecological overlap are structurally less stable. Finding a trend for how $\Delta_S^*$ varies as for a given ecological overlap as the connectance varies is harder because of the large errors.}
