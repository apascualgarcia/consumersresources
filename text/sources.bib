	abstract = {Forty years ago, Robert May questioned a central belief in ecology by proving that sufﬁciently large or complex ecological networks have probability of persisting close to zero. To prove this point, he analyzed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-deﬁned interactions (e.g., predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May’s results to these relationships and ﬁnd remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which increase stability, and mutualistic and competitive, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. These results have broad applicability in ecology. For example, we show that, surprisingly, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks is decreased when we impose realistic food web structure or we introduce a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively impacted by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks.},

Its originally tepid reception among ecologists contrasted starkly with the excitement it caused among physicists and mathematicians. Indeed, {NT} spawned several theoretical studies that attempted to explain empirical data and predicted trends of quantities that had not yet been studied. While there are a few reviews of {NT} oriented towards ecologists, our goal here is to review the quantitative results of {NT} and its extensions for physicists who are interested in learning what {NT} is, what its successes are and what important problems remain unresolved. Furthermore, we hope that this review could also be of interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting results are buried in the vast {NT} literature. We propose to make these more accessible by extracting them and presenting them in a logical fashion. We conclude the review by discussing how one might introduce realistic non-neutral elements into the current models.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
          Microbial communities are complex dynamical systems harbouring many species interacting together to implement higher-level functions. Among these higher-level functions, conversion of organic matter into simpler building blocks by microbial communities underpins biogeochemical cycles and animal and plant nutrition, and is exploited in biotechnology. A prerequisite to predicting the dynamics and stability of community-mediated metabolic conversions, is the development and calibration of appropriate mathematical models. Here, we present a generic, extendable thermodynamic model for community dynamics accounting explicitly for metabolic activities of composing microbes, system {pH}, and chemical exchanges. We calibrate a key parameter of this thermodynamic model, the minimum energy requirement associated with growth-supporting metabolic pathways, using experimental population dynamics data from synthetic communities composed of a sulfate reducer and two methanogens. Our findings show that accounting for thermodynamics is necessary in capturing experimental population dynamics of these synthetic communities that feature relevant species utilising low-energy growth pathways. Furthermore, they provide the first estimates for minimum energy requirements of methanogenesis and elaborates on previous estimates of lactate fermentation by sulfate reducers. The open-source nature of the developed model and demonstration of its use for estimating a key thermodynamic parameter should facilitate further thermodynamic modelling of microbial communities.},

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer–resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory’s impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

	abstract = {Competition in ecology is often modeled in terms of direct, negative effects of one individual on another. An example is logistic growth, modeling the effects of intraspecific competition, while the Lotka-Volterra equations for competition extend this to systems of multiple species, with varying strengths of intra- and interspecific competition. These equations are a classic and well-used staple of quantitative ecology, providing a framework to understand species interactions, species coexistence, and community assembly. They can be derived from an assumption of random mixing of organisms, and an outcome of each interaction that removes one or more individuals. However, this framing is somewhat unsatisfactory, and ecologists may prefer to think of phenomenological equations for competition as deriving from competition for a set of resources required for growth, which in turn may undergo their own complex dynamics. While it is intuitive that these frameworks are connected, and the connection is well-understood near to equilibria, here, we ask the question: when can consumer dynamics alone become an exact description of a full system of consumers and resources? We identify that consumer-resource systems with this property must have some kind of redundancy in the original description, or equivalently there is one or more conservation laws for quantities that do not change with time. Such systems are known in mathematics as integrable systems. We suggest that integrability in consumer-resource dynamics can only arise in cases where each species in an assemblage requires a distinct and unique combination of resources, and even in these cases, it is not clear that the resulting dynamics will lead to Lotka-Volterra competition.},

	abstract = {Predicting the variation of biodiversity across the surface of the Earth is a fundamental issue in ecology, and in this article we focus on one of the most widely studied spatial biodiversity patterns: the species–area relationship ({SAR}). The {SAR} is a central tool in conservation, being used to predict species loss following global climate change, and is striking in its universality throughout different geographical regions and across the tree of life. In this article we draw upon the methods of quantum ﬁeld theory and the foundation of neutral community ecology to derive the ﬁrst spatially explicit neutral prediction for the {SAR}. We ﬁnd that the {SAR} has three phases, with a power law increase at intermediate scales, consistent with decades of documented empirical patterns. Our model also provides a building block for incorporating non-neutral biological variation, with the potential to bridge the gap between neutral and niche-based approaches to community assembly.},

	abstract = {Syntrophic interactions, where species consume metabolites excreted by others, are common in microbial communities, and have uses in synthetic biology. Syntrophy is likely to arise when trade-offs favor an organism that specializes on particular metabolites, rather than all possible metabolites. Several trade-offs have been suggested; however, few models consider different trade-offs to test which are most consistent with observed patterns. Here, we develop a differential equation model to study competition between a syntrophic processing chain, where each microbe can perform one step in metabolizing an initial resource to a ﬁnal state, and a metabolic generalist that can perform all metabolic functions. We also examine how competition affects the production of the ﬁnal metabolic compound. We ﬁnd that competitive outcomes can be predicted by a generalization of the Rn-rule and relative nonlinearity. Therefore, the species that can persist at the lowest resource level is the competitive dominant in a constant environment, and species can coexist by partitioning variation in resources. We derive a simple rule for predicting production rates of the ﬁnal metabolite, and show that competition may not maximize ﬁnal metabolite production. We show that processing chains are inherently less efﬁcient, because resources are lost during each step of the process. Our results also suggest which trade-offs are capable of explaining certain empirical observations. For example, processing chains appear to be more common in nutrient-rich environments; our model suggests that a speciﬁcity trade-off and an afﬁnity-yield trade-off would not predict this, but a yield-maximum growth trade-off might.},

	abstract = {The study of local stability has a long tradition in community ecology. Stability describes whether an ecological system will eventually return to its original steady state after being perturbed. More recently, the study of the transient dynamics of ecological systems has been recognized as crucial, given that continuously disturbed systems might never reach a steady state, and thus the instantaneous response to perturbations could largely determine species persistence. A stable equilibrium can be non-reactive—all perturbations decay immediately, or reactive—some perturbations are initially ampliﬁed before decaying. Here we derive analytical criteria for the reactivity of large ecological systems in which species interact at random. We ﬁnd that in large ecological systems both stability and reactivity are governed by the same quantities: number of species, means of the intra- and inter-speciﬁc interaction strengths, variance of inter-speciﬁc interactions, and the correlation of pairwise interactions. We identify two phase transitions, one from non-reactivity to reactivity and one from stability to instability. As reactivity is an intermediate state between non-reactivity and instability, it could be used to develop an early-warning signal for systems approaching instability.},

To date, there have been no mechanistic or statistical explanations for the form of food web degree distributions. Here, I introduce models for food web degree distributions based on the principle of maximum entropy ({MaxEnt}) and show that the distributions of the number of consumers and resources in 23 (45\%) and 35 (69\%) of 51 food webs are not significantly different at a 95\% confidence level from the {MaxEnt} distribution. These findings offer a new null model for the most probable degree distributions in food webs and other networks. They suggest that there is relatively little pressure favoring generalist or specialist consumption strategies but that biological drivers or methodological bias may force the consumer distribution away from the {MaxEnt} form.},

	abstract = {The study of ecological communities often involves detailed simulations of complex networks. However, our empirical knowledge of these networks is typically incomplete and the space of simulation models and parameters is vast, leaving room for uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modeling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning, and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this “disordered” limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.},

	abstract = {Understanding the causes and effects of network structural features is a key task in deciphering complex systems. In this context, the property of network nestedness has aroused a fair amount of interest as regards ecological networks. Indeed, Bastolla et al. introduced a simple measure of network nestedness which opened the door to analytical understanding, allowing them to conclude that biodiversity is strongly enhanced in highly nested mutualistic networks. Here, we suggest a slightly refined version of such a measure of nestedness and study how it is influenced by the most basic structural properties of networks, such as degree distribution and degree-degree correlations (i.e. assortativity). We find that most of the empirically found nestedness stems from heterogeneity in the degree distribution. Once such an influence has been discounted – as a second factor – we find that nestedness is strongly correlated with disassortativity and hence – as random networks have been recently found to be naturally disassortative – they also tend to be naturally nested just as the result of chance.},

	abstract = {Modern problems in astronomical Bayesian inference require efﬁcient methods for sampling from complex, high-dimensional, often multimodal probability distributions. Most popular methods, such as {MCMC} sampling, perform poorly on strongly multimodal probability distributions, rarely jumping between modes or settling on just one mode without ﬁnding others. Parallel tempering addresses this problem by sampling simultaneously with separate Markov chains from tempered versions of the target distribution with reduced contrast levels. Gaps between modes can be traversed at higher temperatures, while individual modes can be efﬁciently explored at lower temperatures. In this paper, we investigate how one might choose the ladder of temperatures to achieve more efﬁcient sampling, as measured by the autocorrelation time of the sampler. In particular, we present a simple, easily implemented algorithm for dynamically adapting the temperature conﬁguration of a sampler while sampling. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the temperature spacing to achieve a uniform rate of exchanges between chains at neighbouring temperatures. We compare the algorithm to conventional geometric temperature conﬁgurations on a number of test distributions and on an astrophysical inference problem, reporting efﬁciency gains by a factor of 1.2–2.5 over a well-chosen geometric temperature conﬁguration and by a factor of 1.5–5 over a poorly chosen conﬁguration. On all of these problems, a sampler using the dynamical adaptations to achieve uniform acceptance ratios between neighbouring chains outperforms one that does not.},

We show how May’s celebrated ‘‘stability criterion’’ can be derived using random matrix theory, and how extensions of the so-called circular law for the limiting distribution of the eigenvalues of large random matrix can further our understanding of ecological systems. Our goal is to present the more technical material in an accessible way, and to provide pointers to the primary mathematical literature on this subject.

	abstract = {Recent theory and experiments have reported a reproducible tendency for the coexistence of microbial species under controlled environmental conditions. This observation has been explained in the context of competition for resources and metabolic complementarity given that, in microbial communities ({MCs}), many excreted by-products of metabolism may also be resources. {MCs} therefore play a key role in promoting their own stability and in shaping the niches of the constituent taxa. We suggest that an intermediate level of organization between the species and the community level may be pervasive, where tightly knit metabolic interactions create discrete consortia that are stably maintained. We call these units Metabolically Cohesive Consortia ({MeCoCos}) and we discuss the environmental context in which we expect their formation, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of their existence. We argue that the ability to identify {MeCoCos} would open new avenues to link the species-, community- and ecosystem-level properties, with consequences for our understanding of microbial ecology and evolution, and an improved ability to predict ecosystem functioning in the wild.

The composition of the vertebrate gut microbiota is influenced by diet, host morphology and phylogeny, and in this respect the human gut bacterial community is typical of an omnivorous primate. However, the vertebrate gut microbiota is different from free-living communities that are not associated with animal body habitats. We propose that the recently initiated international Human Microbiome Project should strive to include a broad representation of humans, as well as other mammalian and environmental samples, as comparative analyses of microbiotas and their microbiomes are a powerful way to explore the evolutionary history of the biosphere.},

Irrigation with wastewater may have implications at two different levels: alter the physicochemical and microbiological properties of the soil and/or introduce and contribute to the accumulation of chemical and biological contaminants in soil. The ﬁrst may affect soil productivity and fertility; the second may pose serious risks to the human and environmental health. The sustainable wastewater reuse in agriculture should prevent both types of effects, requiring a holistic and integrated risk assessment. In this article we critically review possible effects of irrigation with treated wastewater, with special emphasis on soil microbiota. The maintenance of a rich and diversiﬁed autochthonous soil microbiota and the use of treated wastewater with minimal levels of potential soil contaminants are proposed as sine qua non conditions to achieve a sustainable wastewater reuse for irrigation.},

However, examples from past and current scientiﬁc discoveries suggest that a new, simple but wider deﬁnition is necessary to cover all aspects of microbial syntrophy. We suggest the term ‘obligately mutualistic metabolism’, which still focuses on microbial metabolic cooperation but also includes an ecological aspect: the beneﬁt for both partners. By the combined metabolic activity of microorganisms, endergonic reactions can become exergonic through the efﬁcient removal of products and therefore enable a microbial community to survive with minimal energy resources. Here, we explain the principles of classical and non-classical syntrophy and illustrate the concepts with various examples. We present biochemical fundamentals that allow microorganism to survive under a range of environmental conditions and to drive important biogeochemical processes. Novel technologies have contributed to the understanding of syntrophic relationships in cultured and uncultured systems. Recent research highlights that obligately mutualistic metabolism is not limited to certain metabolic pathways nor to certain environments or microorganisms. This beneﬁcial microbial interaction is not restricted to the transfer of reducing agents such as hydrogen or formate, but can also involve the exchange of organic, sulfurous- and nitrogenous compounds or the removal of toxic compounds.},

	abstract = {Pairwise models are commonly used to describe many-species communities. In these models, an individual receives additive fitness effects from pairwise interactions with each species in the community ('additivity assumption'). All pairwise interactions are typically represented by a single equation where parameters reflect signs and strengths of fitness effects ('universality assumption'). Here, we show that a single equation fails to qualitatively capture diverse pairwise microbial interactions. We build mechanistic reference models for two microbial species engaging in commonly-found chemical-mediated interactions, and attempt to derive pairwise models. Different equations are appropriate depending on whether a mediator is consumable or reusable, whether an interaction is mediated by one or more mediators, and sometimes even on quantitative details of the community (e.g. relative fitness of the two species, initial conditions). Our results, combined with potential violation of the additivity assumption in many-species communities, suggest that pairwise modeling will often fail to predict microbial dynamics.
          , 
            From the soil to our body, microbes, such as bacteria, are everywhere and affect us in many ways. Many microbes perform important roles in natural environments and for our health, but some of them can cause harm and lead to diseases. Often, microbes affect and interact with each other within large groups or communities. Because of their widespread ramifications, it is important to understand how microbial communities work.
            In addition to experiments, mathematical modeling offers one way to gain insight into the dynamics of microbial communities. A model commonly used to describe the interactions between organisms is the so-called ‘pairwise model’. Pairwise models can be useful to predict the dynamics of a community in which two species physically interact, such as a predator-prey community. However, it was unknown if this model was suitable to adequately predict the dynamics of microbial species in communities. Microbes often interact via chemicals that diffuse in the environment. For example, one microbe might provide food for another microbe or release toxins to kill it. However, a pairwise model does not consider food or toxins, but only how one microbe stimulates or inhibits the growth of another.
            Momeni et al. simulated different scenarios commonly found in microbial communities to test whether a pairwise model could capture how, for example, chemicals released by one bacterial species would either help others to grow or stop them from growing. The results showed that for many scenarios, pairwise models cannot qualitatively represent the dynamics of a microbial community.
            A next step will be to work on the limitations of current experimental technologies and mathematical models to improve the understanding of microbial communities. This knowledge could be used to develop new strategies for ecosystem engineering, such as for example making soils more fertile to improve crop yields, or tackling antibiotic resistance of bacteria.},

Large and comprehensive networks, like Metabolic-Expression networks that explicitly accounts for the demands of macromolecular synthesis at single nucleotide resolution, are inherently multiscale because reaction rates can vary over many orders of magnitude. Naively using standard optimization systems to conduct ﬂux balance analysis can produce inaccurate or infeasible results.
Results We describe lifting techniques that enable oﬀ-the-shelf optimization software to compute accurate solutions to the poorly scaled optimization problems arising from ﬂux balance analysis of multiscale biochemical reaction networks. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of lifting using the ﬁrst integrated reconstruction of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis for E. coli.
Conclusion Lifting techniques enable accurate ﬂux balance analysis of multiscale networks using oﬀ-the-shelf optimization software. Although we describe these techniques in the context of ﬂux balance analysis, our methods can be used to handle a variety of optimization problems arising from analysis of multiscale network reconstructions.},
