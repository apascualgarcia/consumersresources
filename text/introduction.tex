\section{Establishing the model and the goals}
We want to write down a consumers-resources model (CRM) which describes the coupled evolution between $N_S$ different species of biomass (denoted $S_i$ with $i = 1, \dots, N_S$) and the $N_R$ resources they feed off (denoted $R_\mu$ with $\mu = 1, \dots, N_R$).

The coupled evolution of the set of variables $\{R_\mu, S_i\}$ is given by:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq : differential eq for resources and species}
\begin{empheq}[left=\empheqlbrace]{align}
  \frac{dR_\mu}{dt} &= l_\mu - m_\mu R_\mu - \sum_{j} \gamma_{j\mu} R_\mu S_j + \sum_j \alpha_{\mu j} S_j \label{eq : differential eq for resources}\\
  \frac{dS_i}{dt} &= \sum_\nu \sigma_{i\nu} \gamma_{i\nu} R_\nu S_i- d_i S_i - \sum_\nu \tau_{\nu i} S_i \label{eq : differential eq for species}
\end{empheq}
\end{subequations}

We will call the variables $\{l_\mu, m_\mu, \gamma_{i\mu}, \alpha_{\mu i}, \sigma_{i\mu}, d_i, \tau_{\mu i}\}$ \textit{parameters of the model}. On the other hand, because they may dynamically evolve, $\{R_\mu, S_i\}$ will be refered to as \textit{dynamical variables} or simply \textit{variables}. Note that there are in this model a lot of different symbols that may be easy to confuse. We will at least try to keep the following conventions :
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quantities related to resources have subscripts in greek alphabet (\eg the resource $\mu$ abudance $R_\mu$). Quantities related to species have subscripts in latin alphabet (\eg the species $i$ abundance $S_i$). Finally, quantities related to both have both indices.
  \item Vectors (\ie quantities with one index) are written with the latin alphabet (\eg the resource $\mu$ death rate $m_\mu$).
  \item Matrices (\ie quantities with two indices, usually relating resources and species) are written with the greek alphabet (\eg the rate $\gamma_{i\mu}$ at which species $i$ consumes resource $\mu$).
\end{itemize}

Our model tries to take numerous phenomena into account and it therefore may be helpful to take the time to explain the different terms of each differential equation. The temporal evolution of a resource $R_\mu$ is essentially driven by the following processes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constant input from an outsider experimenter : this corresponds to the constant $+l_\mu$ term,
  \item Natural diffusion/deterioration at rate $m_\mu$ : this corresponds to the $-m_\mu R_\mu$ term,
  \item Consumption by the biomass species $S_j$ at a rate $\gamma_{j\mu}$. In total this corresponds to the Lotka-Volterra style term [\textbf{insert ref}] $-\sum_j \gamma_{j\mu}R_\nu S_j$,
  \item Production coming from the species $S_j$ at a rate $\alpha_{\mu j}$: $+\sum_j \alpha_{\mu j} S_j$. This is essentially what makes this model different from traditional CRMs [\textbf{insert ref}].
\end{itemize}
On the other hand, biomass of species $S_i$ changes because of the following processes [\textbf{insert figure}]:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Consumption of resource $R_\nu$ at a rate $\gamma_{i\nu}$. Only a fraction $\sigma_{i\nu}$ of this is allocated to biomass growth : $+\sum_\nu \sigma_{i\nu} \gamma_{i\nu}R_\nu S_i$.
  \item Cell death/diffusion at rate $d_i$ : this is the $-d_i S_i$ term.
  \item Release of resource $R_\nu$ at rate $\tau_{\nu i}$ (this is the syntrophic interaction). In total $-\sum_\nu \tau_{\nu i} S_i$.
\end{itemize}
We will mostly focus on the case where no resource coming from syntrophy is lost, \ie $\tau_{\mu i} = \alpha_{\mu i}$.

The aim of the project is to study equilibria points of this model and their stability. In particular, we are interested in how syntrophy changes the robustness of the equilibria.

\subsection{Attack strategy and important notions}
Before jumping right into the matter, it is important to explain how we will study this system of differential equations. Mainly two different but complimenteray approaches will be used : analytical and numerical. Note that the $\sim$ 5'000 lines of code we wrote from scratch and that we use to get the results of Section \ref{chapter : numerical analysis} is available at the address \url{https://gitlab.ethz.ch/palberto/consumersresources.git}.

\subsubsection{Metaparameters}
Studying the equilibria of our CRM will lead us to establish and study several relations involving the different variables of the problem. Namely, these are : $l_\mu, m_\mu, \gamma_{i\mu}, \alpha_{\mu i}, \sigma_{i\mu}, d_i, \tau_{\mu i}, R^*_\mu$ and $S^*_i$ $\forall i=1, \dots, N_S; \mu=1, \dots, N_R$. Without taking into account the constraints on these parameters, there are $N_R+N_R+N_RN_S+N_RN_S+N_RN_S+N_S+N_RN_S+N_R+N_S=3N_R+2N_S+4N_RN_S$ free parameters.

 The goal is to study microbial communities with a large number of consumers and resources, typically $N_R, N_S \approx 25, 50, 100, \dots$ \ie $\sim 2'500$ or more free parameters and so it is clear that a precise study on each element of each matrix is way too tenuous of a job. It's easier to look at it from a statistical point of view, \ie we will write a matrix $q_{i\mu}$ as \cite{pascual-garcia_mutualism_2017} :
 \begin{equation}
 q_{i\mu} = \mathcal{Q} Q_{i\mu}
 \end{equation}
where $\mathcal{Q}$ is a random variable of mean $Q_0$ and standard deviation $\sigma_Q$. $Q_{i\mu}$ is a binary matrix that, if interpreted as an adjacency matrix, tells about the network structure of the quantity $q_{i\mu}$.

\noindent We apply this way of thinking to the parameters of our problem, namely we can write :
\begin{subequations}
\begin{empheq}{align}
l_\mu &= \mathcal{L} \\
m_\mu &= \mathcal{M} \\
\gamma_{i\mu} &= \mathcal{G} G_{i\mu} \\
\alpha_{\mu i} &= \mathcal{A} A_{\mu i} \\
\sigma_{i\mu} &= \mathcal{S} \\
d_i &= \mathcal{D} \\
\tau_{\mu i} &= \mathcal{T} \\
R^*_\mu &= \mathcal{R} \\
S^*_i &= \mathcal{S}
\end{empheq}
\end{subequations}
Note that we did not put any explicit topological structure on $l_\mu, m_\mu, d_i, R^*_\mu, S^*_i$ and $\sigma_{i\mu}$ because we require these to always be larger than zero (in particular for $S^*$ and $R^*$, we require positive-valued equilibria \cite{butler_stability_2018}).

In order to make computations analytically tractable, we will require a small standard deviation on the parameters involved in the problem. In that regime, every random variable $\mathcal{Q}$ is well approximated by its average value $Q_0$. While studying things analytically we will hence often come back to the following approximation:
\begin{subequations}\label{eq : metaparameters approximations}
\begin{empheq}{align}
l_\mu &\approx l_0 \\
m_\mu &\approx m_0 \\
\gamma_{i\mu} &\approx\gamma_0 G_{i\mu} \\
\alpha_{\mu i} &\approx \alpha_0 A_{\mu i} \\
\sigma_{i\mu} &\approx \sigma_0 \\
d_i &\approx d_0 \\
\tau_{\mu i} &\approx \tau_0 T_{\mu i} \\
R^*_\mu &\approx R_0 \\
S^*_i &\approx S_0
\end{empheq}
\end{subequations}
This greatly reduces the number of parameters from $3N_R+2N_S+4N_RN_S$ (continous) to $9$ (continous) + $3N_RN_S$ (binary).

Mathematically, we hence will mostly work in the 9-dimensional metaparameters space $\mathcal{M}$.

\subsubsection{Matrix properties}
Instead of looking at each entry of the binary matrices $G, A$ and $T$ individually, we will reduce even more the complexity of the problem by considering only some globally defined quantities of these matrices. For a matrix $M_{ij}$ the metrics interesting to us are most of all:
\begin{itemize}
\item Its \textbf{nestedness}: this measures how ``nested'' the system is, \ie if there are clusters grouped together\footnote{In typical Lotka-Volterra models, where only species-species interactions are considered, \eg \cite{iannelli_introduction_2014}, measuring the nestedness of the $\gamma$ consumption matrix would be in the same spirit as counting how many niches there are in the community.}. It is known \cite{bastolla_architecture_2009, pascual-garcia_mutualism_2017} that nestedness can play a profound role in the dynamics of ecological communities. Although it is somewhat controversed \cite{jonhson_factors_2013}, we will keep the definition of the nestedness $\eta(M)$ of a binary matrix $M$ as it was used in \cite{bastolla_architecture_2009}:
\begin{equation}
\eta(M)\defined \frac{\sum_{i<j} n_{ij}}{\sum_{i < j} \min(n_i, n_j)}
\end{equation}
where the number of links $n_i$ is simply the degree of the $i$-th row of $M$
\begin{equation}
n_i \defined \sum_k M_{ik},
\end{equation}
and $n_{ij}$ is the overlap matrix defined as
\begin{equation}
n_{ij}\defined \sum_k M_{ik}M_{jk}.
\end{equation}

\item Its \textbf{connectance} : this measure, simply defined as the ratio of non-zero links in a matrix, is central in the study of plants-and-animals systems \cite{pascual-garcia_mutualism_2017}. It is formally defined for a matrix $q_{ij}$  of size $N\times M$ as :
\begin{equation}
\kappa(q)\defined \frac{\sum_{ij} Q_{ij}}{NM}
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is the (binary) network adjacency matrix of $q$.



\end{itemize}
