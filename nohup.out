Attempting now to find the critical delta for the given set of metaparameters
Computing average extinction for delta=0 with food matrix ./matrices/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.2336.txt
Average extinction for Delta = 0 is 0 +/- 0
Computing average extinction for delta=1 with food matrix ./matrices/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.2336.txt
Average extinction for Delta = 1 is 18.48 +/- 2.20611
We first find a rough interval where the critical delta should lie (each point computed by the solver is estimated with 50 runs)
Computing average extinction for delta=0.0541126 with food matrix ./matrices/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.2336.txt
Average extinction for Delta = 0.0541126 is 3.92 +/- 1.38269
Computing average extinction for delta=0.0138042 with food matrix ./matrices/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.2336.txt
Average extinction for Delta = 0.0138042 is 0.46 +/- 0.542481
Computing average extinction for delta=0.0274801 with food matrix ./matrices/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.2336.txt
Average extinction for Delta = 0.0274801 is 1.36 +/- 0.875051
Computing average extinction for delta=0.0220097 with food matrix ./matrices/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.2336.txt
Average extinction for Delta = 0.0220097 is 1.06 +/- 0.818411
Computing average extinction for delta=0.0210251 with food matrix ./matrices/Nr25_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr25_Nc25_Nest0.25_Conn0.2336.txt
Average extinction for Delta = 0.0210251 is 0.9 +/- 0.814411
Found an interval for Delta critical : [0.0210251;0.0220097]
Now computing the average number of extinctions for ten points inside this interval (500 runs per point)
