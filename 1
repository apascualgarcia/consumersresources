Successfully opened data_output/critical_delta_50points_200runs.out, attempting now to find the critical delta of every listed matrix 
Now attempting to find the critical delta for the following set of parameters : gamma0 = 0.75; alpha0 = 0.0039; sigma0 = 0.25; l0 = 1;p = 0.5; R0 = 1; S0 = 0.05; NR = 50; NS = 25; matrix path = optimal_matrices/consumption/Nr50_Nc25/RandTrix_Nr50_Nc25_Nest0.15_Conn0.12.txt; convergence threshold = 1e-08
We first find a rough interval where we know the critical delta will lie (50 runs per point). 
We first test if the probability of extinction is strictly greater than zero for Delta=1
Computing probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=1
Probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=1 is 1
We look for a point slightly above zero.
Computing probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=0
Probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=0 is 0
Computing probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=1
Probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=1 is 1
Computing probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=0
Probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=0 is 0
Computing probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=1
Probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=1 is 1
Computing probability of getting one or more extinctions for Delta=0.01
