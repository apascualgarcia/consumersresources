* Each folder contains a set of binary matrices of size specified by the name of the folder, where
Nr stands for number of resources and Nc for number of consumers (although obviously are interchangeable).

* The matrices are binary, and have a connectance and nestedness specified in the label. Across folders, the
nestedness are the same (within a +- 0.005 precision) and the connectances (+- 0.01), while the nestedness
is labelled by the rounded value to the first significant digit, the connectances have three digits.

* The specific values of are presented in a file "Properties-Summary" with the header:
  * TargetConn: target value at the start of the simulation for the connectance
  * TargetNest: same for the nestedness
  * Connectance: actual value at the end of the simulation for the connectance
  * Nestedness: same for the nestedness
  * VarDegree: variance of the degrees of the matrix (should be strongly correlated with the nestedness)

* Each folder contains a figure with the starting values of the networks at the beginning of the simulation (red dots)
and at the end (blue crosses). The simulation consists of an independent realization of the connectance, plus 
a nesting procedure with a MonteCarlo algorithm. The connectance and the nestedness are also related, and the connectance
constitutes a lower bound for the nestedness, therefore it was not attempted to generate matrices with lower 
nestedness than the value of the connectance (I don't remember how strict it is but I didn't try to generate nestedness values below those of the connectance).
